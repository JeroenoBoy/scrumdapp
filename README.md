# scrumdapp

Welcome to Scrumdapp! A tool made for squads within Open-ICT to manage their daily check-ins and share them with their coaches. 

The full tool is build using the latest version of [ktor](https://ktor.io/). 

Fun fact! One of the challenges and design requirments of this tool was to not use any Javascript on the both the front- and backend. This required some creative htmlcss solution to create all the functionality required for Scrumdapp to properly function.
